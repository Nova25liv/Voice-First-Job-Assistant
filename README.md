# Voice-First Job Assistant for Solo Trades

## Overview
This is a conceptual project for a voice-first field operations assistant designed for solo tradespeople who manage every aspect of their work alone — from small engine repair to building installs, fencing, dirt work, garage doors, and more. 

The goal is to allow a tradesperson to **stay in the field doing the work** while the system handles administrative tasks like:
- Job recording
- Automatic pricing and estimate generation
- Material list creation
- Invoice creation and sending
- Scheduling and task tracking
- Email notifications and payment processing

## Problem Statement
Many skilled tradespeople spend more time on admin than on the actual work they excel at. Managing estimates, invoices, material lists, and scheduling manually consumes energy and slows down business growth. This project proposes a solution that **minimizes admin, maximizes hands-on work**, and increases efficiency.

## Core Idea
- Capture job details via **voice input**
- Convert job details into structured outputs (estimate, invoice, task list)
- Simplify tracking and reporting
- Support pricing for any type of job automatically
- Reduce the cognitive load of business management

## Current Status
- Concept defined and timestamped publicly via GitHub README
- Workflow is being manually tested with one active user (my husband)

## Notes
This is an early-stage concept intended for proof-of-existence and workflow validation. Iteration and development will follow once the workflow is tested and validated.
